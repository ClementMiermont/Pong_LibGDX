Howdy !

As i'm making studies in programming, i try to learn other languages that are not in my cursus and create games with it during my freetime.
This time, i challenged myself to make a basic Pong in Java using libGDX framework. It's not perfect, but it was fun to do. and the principles are here.

you have : 

- Player direction control with arrows keys
- collisions with balls
- collisions with opponents
- collisions with game's plate edges
- score calculation system
- Victory and Defeat screen
- A besic opponent behaviour
- A system to recreat a ball if unfortunately it appears to be out of the gameedges (but not perfect, you probably have to relaunch the game)

Please notice that i try to clean the font i use for this project, but they are still strange artifacts that i wasn't, sadly, been able to make disappear. Can't do more at my current level.

Also, as i'm discovering libGDX, i don't know which stuff to touch or not, in the project solution ... 
So i included the whole in this repo. So it include the gradle's configuration i used with Intellij Community.
But the source code you are looking for is located in the .java files in " Pong\Pong_Sources_Files\core\src\main\java\io\Github\Pong "

The build is a jar file located in " Pong_Build ". 
Just open it with by right clicking with java (TM) platform SE library.

Also i configured this project only for windows users. 
Sorry for Mac and Androids users ... As i said, i maid this during my freetime, the intent is not to do a " pro " thing with a multi platform management. 
But i enjoyed making it and it was a cool challenge ! 

So, in order to end with this goods words,
Please take a good care of you !

Cl√©ment M,
your frenchie dev.
